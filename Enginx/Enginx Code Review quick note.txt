If you use frameworks in development, they will greatly impact your coding standards.
For example, front-end frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular or back-end frameworks like Spring and Django have their own coding standards and best practices that are endorsed by a well-established community of developers or framework owners.

Static code analysis tools can scan code without executing it. They can detect not only typos, dead code, and other errors but also potential bugs and vulnerabilities. These tools support integration with unit test frameworks and can control code coverage.
The most popular and widely used tool is 𝐒𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐫𝐐𝐮𝐛𝐞.

The main feature of dynamic code analysis is identifying problems during code runtime. These can be security issues, performance problems, memory leaks, null pointer dereferencing, etc. This practice is rather unpopular due to its complexity. Still, it is often used in high-performance computing (HPC) projects:
Oil and gas discovery
Defense and aerospace work
Automotive design
Financial forecasting industries
The most popular tool to date is 𝐎𝐖𝐀𝐒𝐏 𝐙𝐞𝐝 𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐱𝐲 (𝐙𝐀𝐏).

There are also some language-specific tools that can help maintain code quality:
